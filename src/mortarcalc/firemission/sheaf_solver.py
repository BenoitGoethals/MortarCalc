"""Sheaf solvers as Strategy (SOLID — Open/Closed).

Add a new sheaf type by writing a new `SheafSolver` subclass and registering
it in `SHEAF_SOLVERS`. The dispatcher in `solution.py` looks up the right
strategy by the FireMission's sheaf value, without needing to change the
existing solvers (Open for extension, closed for modification).
